### Ensure Readability

- Indent with 2 spaces. Never use tabs.

- Lowercase attribute and tag names only.

- Write one discrete element per line.

- Boolean attributes without any values eg: checked rather than checked="checked"

- Only use double quotes in HTML.

- Always include closing tags.

- Do not include a trailing slash in self-closing elements.
