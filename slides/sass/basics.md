- LibSass is a C/C++ port of Sass and is used in Node.js

- Going forward they will be maintained at the same speed.
- Fits better in our NPM workflow

- Can edit Sass files in browser using Chrome&rsquo;s [local file editing](https://medium.com/@toolmantim/getting-started-with-css-sourcemaps-and-in-browser-sass-editing-b4daab987fb0)
- Super easy to generate using `gulp-sass` or `gulp-sourcemaps`
